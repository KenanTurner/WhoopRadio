	+"Howdy!" + "\n"
	+"	Now that I have your attention, let me explain a few things. "
	+"Most of this code was stitched together at the last second. A lot of it is first pass with very little oversight. "
	+"However, the most important part of the code (music-manager.js and framework.js) got plenty of love. "
	+"I highly suggest you check them out, or visit the repo at https://github.com/KenanTurner/music-manager. "
	+"(Keep in mind my website uses a custom version not provided in the github) "
	+"Currently all of the code is hosted on a private github repository which deployes directly to the webserver. "
	+"I plan on releasing the code for the website to the public when the code is finished. "
	+"In the meantime, feel free to snoop through my code, just don't touch anything. "
	+"If you find some security vulnerability or just want to talk, email me at coolspykee@satx.rr.com" + "\n"
